# Dynamic Uniform Card Layout

## Overview

This project demonstrates a responsive card layout using CSS Grid. The layout adjusts dynamically based on the available space in the container, ensuring that all cards have the same width based on the first row's width.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The card layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining uniformity across rows.
- **Dynamic Columns**: The number of columns adjusts automatically based on the container's width.
- **CSS Grid**: Utilizes CSS Grid properties for efficient layout management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m97chahboun/css_flexible_wrap.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd css_flexible_wrap
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the layout.

## Usage

- The cards are styled to maintain a consistent look and feel across different devices.
- You can modify the number of cards by adding or removing `<div class="card">...</div>` elements in the HTML file.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the following:

- **Card Styles**: Modify the `.card` class in the CSS to change colors, padding, margins, etc.
- **Grid Settings**: Adjust the `grid-template-columns` property in the CSS to change the minimum column width or layout behavior.
